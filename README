efl.vapi & libeflvala
=====================

efl.vapi contains vala bindings for the
Enlightenment Foundation Libraries.
It is usable with or without libeflvala.

libeflvala contains additional convenience
objects for applications written in vala
using the efl.

Roadmap
=======

Full Elementary support is going to be done first,
adding dependencies (evas) as we go. Later on,
adding edje and ecore for applications that do not
want to use elementary.

Problems
========
Elementary.h needs to be patched, since Vala does not
support anonymous structs and delegates.
